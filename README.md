# Exploring IMDB Reviews with RNNs, LSTMs, and, Transformers 

As a part of an intro to deep learning class at Caltech, I trained 3 popular Deep Learning architectures on teh iMDB dataset and compared their performance. The results highlight the advantages and  RNN shorcomings of each architecture.
This project piqued my interest in recommendation models and sentiment analysis on reviews which I continue to exlore in my ```MDL Recommender``` project.
